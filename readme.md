This is an group project for [CS140](http://cs140.org), Natural Language Annotation for Machine Learning, under Prof. James Pustejovsky, in the spring 2016 semester.

## Team members
* Jessica Huynh
* Ryan Nicoll
* Yuzhe Chen

## Goals
* To use the [TOEFL11](https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2014T06) corpus for native language identification for non-native speakers of English from among the 11 given native languages in the texts in the corpus (Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, Telugu, and Turkish)
* To annotate non-native speakers' language features (syntactic, lexical)
* To determine which features are representative of particular native languages
* To develop a specification by determining the most salient language features for these purposes, that are better than using structural features
