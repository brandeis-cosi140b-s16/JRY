Week 2 Update -- Week of March 19th, 2016

Our specification and DTD have changed this week to accommodate some recommendations
from our annotators as well as to simplify the overall process. We've also narrowed
the scope of our task from 11 languages down to six. As our specification
has been almost entirely rewritten (i.e. 13 pages of changed material) and we spent
the majority of the week deciding and implementing these new changes, we've just released
our package today for our annotators to be able to annotate. 
Our annotators will be doing 48 documents per week for 3 languages, giving us 16 documents per language.
