\section{Goals} % (fold)
\label{par:expectations}
Our expectations for the course project are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item To use the TOEFL11 corpus for native language identification for non-native speakers of English from among the 11 given native languages in the texts in the corpus (Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, Telugu, and Turkish)
    \item To annotate non-native speakers' language features (syntactic, lexical)
    \item To determine which features are representative of particular native languages
    \item To develop a specification by determining the most salient language features for these purposes, that are better than using structural features
\end{enumerate}
