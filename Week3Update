L1ML: Week 3 Update
Written by: Ryan Nicoll

We've decided that we'll be using a Naive Bayes Classifier as our machine learning algorithm. Given that Naive Bayes
a la "bag of words" was our baseline, we've decided to see if the features we extract from our marked-up data will 
improve upon this baseline metric. To be determined is how to extract these features, although we will probably do so manually
during adjudication (?) 

In terms of the universe of languages we're going to include, we've added back in Japanese to make our universe Arabic, French,
Hindi, Spanish, Telugu, Chinese, and Japanese (7 languages in total). This is as we are curious if our features will allow
for robust classification between Chinese and Japanese, which the baseline bag of words encountered difficulty with. For each
language, we will have 16 marked-up documents (with slightly more for Arabic). 

In terms of annotations we've received, we have the entire set for Arabic, waiting on some for Hindi, waiting on some for
French, and the rest are pending. 

We as a group have conferenced all week over messenger and have met to discuss our progress as well as our data. We will be
meeting in the next week to take a look at our data (and hopefully begin the adjudication process).

I'm still a fan of the colors in MAE :)
